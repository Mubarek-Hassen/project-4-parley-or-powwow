# The Parley Blog
By Mubarek Hassen

## Desription
The Parley Blog is a website where ideas about subjects are transcribed. It is a space where monographs articulate and discuss their subjects with the reader and receive feedbacks or comments. It is also where the readers can share their idea if they have an opposing view.
This website is designed to be simplistic blogger heaven where they work with the publisher and have their contents posted for the public. Ideas should roam free for the good of society. In those ideas, we see the other side. After the brief parley with ourselves or whomever we parleyed with, we get to choose wisely. This is the benefit of Parley.
